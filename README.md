## Description
In this course, Topics in Deep Learning: Healthcare, participants will familiarize themselves with the key concepts and challenges of applying AI/ML technologies in the healthcare (HC) space. Particular emphasis will be placed on understanding why it is challenging to **translate** *in-silico* tools to clinical and biomedical practice. By the end of this course, participants will understand the organizational and institutional requirements for successful AI/ML adoption in HC, the current "cutting edge" applications, and specific technical and statistical tools that are needed in the HC practice area.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Learning outcome 1: Be able to articulate and problem solve the key challenges of ML/AI adoption in healthcare
2. Learning outcome 2: Identify and understand areas of value creation in the healthcare domain using ML/AI in a commercial and business context
3. Learning outcome 3: Use Python-based tools for healthcare focused ML/AI problems like survival analysis, uncertainty quantification, and model explainability

### Delivery instructions
The course runs synchronously over Zoom. The course consists of ten classes over three weeks. Classes are 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM EDT on weekdays. To mitigate online fatigue, each class will include one or two breaks, during which students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask additional questions. 

Tutorial sessions with a TA will also be offered over Zoom. These will take place from 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM on weekdays. 

## Schedule
The schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.

## Prerequisites
Learners are expected to have completed the DSI foundational courses (i.e., Unix Shell/Git and GitHub, Python, R, Building Research Software/SQL, Estimation/Machine Learning/Testing, Production) as well as the Deep Learning Foundations course.

## Expectations
Learners should be active participants and are encouraged to ask questions throughout.
 
### Technology requirements
* Participants require a computer and internet connection to engage in online activities.
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this course more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Course communications:** Communications take place over email, please include "DSI-Topics in Deep Learning" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Topics in Deep Learning: homework question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
