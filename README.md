## Description
In this course, participants will learn how to apply machine learning techniques to software applications using the Python language to . Successful participants will apply each step of the machine learning workflow in relevant industry applications, as well as be exposed to cutting-edge techniques and the underlying theory.  Technical topics include: Machine Learning in Practice, Data Preparation and Feature Engineering, Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, Model Evaluation, and Ensemble Learning.  Participants will also work on other skills, such as networking and building a community of influence, mastering the interview process, including behavioral and technical interviews.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to:

1. Learning outcome 1: Propose and present a business pitch for a machine learning project in a real-world business setting through a business case study with an industry partner or at their current organization.
2. Learning outcome 2: Design, formulate, and construct a full comprehensive lifecycle project in machine learning via a course project by managing a timeline.
3. Learning outcome 3: Apply, deploy, and implement each step of the machine learning lifecycle in Python programming language, and debug errors and iterate on improvements.

### Delivery instructions
The course runs synchronously over Zoom. The course consists of ten classes over three weeks. Classes are 6:00 PM - 8:30 PM EDT on weekdays. Being mindful of online fatigue, there will be one or two breaks during each class where students are encouraged to stretch, grab a drink and snacks, or ask any additional questions. 

Tutorial sessions with a TA will also be offered over Zoom. These will take place from 5:30 PM - 6:00 PM EDT and 8:30 PM - 9:00 PM on weekdays. 

## Schedule
The schedule is tentative and may be modified as needed. Learners will be notified of schedule changes.

## Prerequisites
Learners are expected to have completed the DSI foundational courses (i.e., Unix Shell/Git and GitHub, Python, R, Building Research Software/SQL, Estimation/Machine Learning/Testing, Production) as well as the Deep Learning Foundations course.

## Expectations
Learners should be active participants and are encouraged to ask questions throughout.
 
### Technology requirements
* Learners must have a computer and an internet connection to participate in online activities.
 
## Policies
* **Accessibility:** We want to provide an accessible learning environment for all. If there is something we can do to make this course more accessible to you, please let us know.
* **Course communications:** Communications take place over email, please include "DSI-Topics in Deep Learning" or similar in the subject line, e.g. "DSI-Topics in Deep Learning: homework question"
* **Camera:** Keeping your camera on is optional.
* **Microphone:** Please keep microphones muted unless you need to speak. Please indicate your name before speaking as some Zoom configurations make it hard to tell who is talking!
* **Assessment:** There will be homework which **is not** graded, but highly recommended, and there will be two assignments which **are** graded.
